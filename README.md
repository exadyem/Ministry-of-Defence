For the connection between the Polar H10 heart monitor and the websocket created, we had to reverse engineer the workings of the Polar H10, trying to obtain the heart rate via self written procedures and sending it out via websockets. Geert-Jan van Ouwendorp made this possible, and all code needed is to be found in his GitLab repository linked below. In this repository, it is explained how to properly install the files. 
Mind that only people with an FHICT GitLab account can access this repository, please contact Geert-Jan van Ouwendorp for any issues.
